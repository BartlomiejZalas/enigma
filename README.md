After successfull build the project can be executed as binary from the build directory:
```bash
./build/enigma
```

### Test
To build and run the tests execute the script located in the main project directory:

```bash
./test.sh
```

## Configuration

The program by default uses below Enigma setup. It can be changed by editing `main.cpp` file. List of possible wiring configuration can be found [here](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/wiring.htm#m3).
